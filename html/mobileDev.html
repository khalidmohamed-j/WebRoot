                Android is an open source software stack created for a wide array of devices with different form factors. 
                Android's primary purpose is to create an open software platform available for carriers, OEMs, 
                and developers to make their innovative ideas a reality and to introduce a successful, 
                real-world product that improves the mobile experience for users. <br />
                Android is designed so that there's no central point of failure, where one industry player restricts or controls the innovations of another. 
                The result is a full, production-quality consumer product with source code open for customization and porting.<br />
